                    <div class="text-sm-center">Web Designing is the process of creating websites. It encompasses 
                        several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design. 
                        While the terms web designing and web development are often used interchangeably,
                         web designing is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.</div>

                             What we do on the Web changes every day. The web development industry is constantly 
                             evolving. While we may not be able to tell the day-to-day changes while it's
                              happening, it's easy for us to look back to the past few months and see that a
                               lot of things we do now are much different than what we've been doing before.

                              Because our work lies in one of the fastest-paced industries, it's important for 
                              us to predict and learn about what's coming up or risk being left in the web
                               development dust.

                        <div>While this may sound daunting at first, it's actually pretty easy to see where we'll
                             be in the next several months/years to come. Just as fast as Web 2.0 came, Web 3.0
                              began developing. There are varying definitions of what phase three of the web will
                               be, but the majority of the theories focus around a user-centric approach. Things
                                like i Google, "the portable web" (mobile, i Pad, etc.), pick & choose content,
                                 smarter user interfaces, etc. are all coming about under the new definition of 
                                 3.0.</div>
                              <div>
                                  Web 2.0, in contrast, was more focused around providing the user with content. A
                                   large pool of floating content such as blogs, better search engines, smart SEO,
                                    all made up Web 2.0. As from a design perspective, Web 2.0 consisted of clean
                                     and sleek designs that focused around providing content to the user in a more
                                      efficient way.

                                  The duration of Web Designing workshop will be two consecutive days, with 
                                  eight hours session each day in a total of sixteen hours, properly divided
                                   into theory and hand on practical sessions. At the end of this workshop, 
                                   a competition will be organized among the participating students where
                                    each participating student will get Certificate of Participation and 
                                    the Winners will get Certificate of Merit..
