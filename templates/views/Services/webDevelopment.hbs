                          them 24/7 to observe how they are interacting with clients. In the online world, however,

                             If you’re a store owner and have staff-members, you can’t oversee them 24/7 to observe
                              how they are interacting with clients. In the online world, however, nothing stays

                                researching, and 72 percent of them go online to find educational material,
                                 reviews, and testimonials” according to a recent buyer journey report.</p>

                              It also concluded that 65% of consumers consider a company branded email to be 
                              more credible than a generic email account such as Gmail, Outlook.com, AOL, or
