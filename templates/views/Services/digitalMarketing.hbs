                      <p>Digital marketing is leveraging digital technologies, tactics, and channels to connect
                           organizations with existing and prospective customers. It helps businesses grow, in 
                           spite of constraints like location, by enabling them to reach a targeted audience. 
                           It is a way to influence audiences online - be it through a website, blogs, video 
                           content, social media, or partnerships. Digital Marketing is a constantly evolving 
                           field and marketers must constantly be up-to-date and informed in order to stay ahead 
                           of competitors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The truly unique thing about digital marketing is that we can reach large audiences as well
                         as niche segments of these audiences without compromising scale. Unlike traditional 
                         marketing, we can also track the success of digital campaigns down to revenue, 
                         engagement, clicks, leads etc.

                        <h4>What Is Involved In Digital Marketing?</h4>
                        <hr id="hr" class="mx-auto w-50 text"  style="height:4px;background: #ff9068;;color:#ff9068;;border:none;text-shadow:2px 2px 5px rgba(210, 56, 56, 1.0);"/>
                  
                        <p>

                             technical skills. Navigating digital marketing entails a full fledge process of
                              planning, setting objectives, creating, implementing and revising. In order to
                               successfully execute a digital marketing campaign, a digital marketer possesses 
                               the following:

                        </p>
                        <div class="text-el">
                            * A core understanding of the product, it’s USP, and the organizations objectives<br/>
                            * A strong understanding of target audience and how to find them in the vast internet<br/>

                            * Communication skills that entail copywriting and design. Often, digital marketers seek the help of 
                            specialists in these fields but drive direction and provide a brief.<br/>
                            * Analytical skills that help revisit, revise and optimise<br/>
                            * A hunger to learn and stay up-to-date with digital marketing tools, trends, and changes<br/>
                        </div>
                        <h4>What Are Types Of Digital Marketing?</h4>
                        <hr id="hr" class="mx-auto w-50 text"  style="height:4px;background: #ff9068;;color:#ff9068;;border:none;text-shadow:2px 2px 5px rgba(210, 56, 56, 1.0);"/>
                  
                       <p> Digital Marketing can be of many types:</p>
                        <h5>Inbound Vs Outbound</h5>
                       

<p>Inbound Marketing or “Pull” Marketing involves creating content, blogs, and email newsletters that people
actually wish to read. SEO and paid search help people find this content. If this content is engaging, it helps
build a brand’s equity in the reader’s mind and may drive long-term action.</p>
 <p>
                    Outbound marketing or “push” marketing is one-way communication designed to push a product to
audiences. This includes traditional forms of marketing as well as display advertising and social media
advertising.


                        </p>
                        <h5>Performance Marketing Vs Branding</h5>
                        <p>Performance marketing typically constitutes marketing driven to generate sales such
                             as search engine marketing and social media advertising. This will be directly 
                             related to acquiring leads and customers and generating revenue.</p>
                        <p>
                            Branding Marketing is not based on directly sellingand is designed to build your 
                            brand equity. Examples of digital channels for this are content marketing and
                             social media. These build brand awareness, assist customers, provide valuable
                              information, and build long-term brand connections for the brand.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What Does A Digital Marketing Agency Do?</h4>
                        <hr id="hr" class="mx-auto w-50 text"  style="height:4px;background: #ff9068;;color:#ff9068;;border:none;text-shadow:2px 2px 5px rgba(210, 56, 56, 1.0);"/>
                  
                        <p>A digital marketing agency drives results-based marketing strategy, focusing on 
                            delivering ROI and helping a brand fulfill its objectives using digital skills
                             and technology. They develop strategies to maximize awareness and acquire leads.
                              Digital agencies need to be fast-paced and and balance user-experience with
                            brand perspective</p>
