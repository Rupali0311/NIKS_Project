                            This workshop will focus on the set of software tools (editors, compilers, debuggers,
                             optimization tools, etc.) needed to develop applications for petascale and beyond
                              computers as well as the numerical and communications libraries, programming
                               languages, and software engineering practices needed by the scientists and 
                               engineers to develop these applications. In particular, the workshop will 
                               consider the feasibility of developing an integrated software development 
                               environment for science and engineering applications, similar in concept, 
                               although not in detail, to the IDEs used in the commercial world. Such an 
                               environment would transform the development, debugging, optimization, deployment
                                and execution of scientific and engineering applications on parallel computers,
                                 ranging from the scientist's multicore personal computer to the most sophisticated
                                  NSF- and DOE-funded high-performance computing systems.<br/>

                            Git is today’s premier version control repository and an important collaboration
                             tool for software development organizations because of its ease of use, facilitation
                              of code review, and flexible branching model.<br/>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                            In this deep-dive workshop, we’ll show you how to use the most important Git
                             functions effectively in both the command line and RubyMine IDE. We’ll show
                              you how to initialize, commit, branch, merge, and share repositories with others. 
                              We’ll look at the Github and Bitbucket cloud repo services and examine web flow,
                               pull requests, resolving code conflicts, and deployment systems. We’ll also discuss
                                some best practices for enterprise-level code teams.<br/>

                            This workshop will provide a solid understanding of why distributed version control systems
                             are an essential part of any development effort, and equip you with skills to effectively
                              apply Git to your everyday work.<br/>
