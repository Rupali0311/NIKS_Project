                         leaders by providing them basic knowledge and creating interest in Robotics Field. 
                         Today there is a great demand of professionals in the related areas wherein our vision
                          is to provide quality education keeping in minds the methodologies and interest between
                           the students.</p>

                          People would call you a mentally retarded guy if you voiced your opinion however 
                          that is not the case today. Rapid developments have made robotic technology professions
                           among the most exciting available to recent graduates Positions within the robotics
                            industry generally are the different stages of the engineering process. Some engineers,
                             for example, are responsible for the planning as to how robotics might address a 
                             problem make the process more efficient. Others apply the available engineering 
                             principles towards making of the real Robot.<br/>

                            The robotics industry also employs a whole platoon of support staff, like testers,
                             programmers and operators. So this means that there are career opportunities in 
                             robotics as well !<br/>

                            Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, 
                            and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics. This is a rapidly developing 
                            field, with advances in computing constantly opening up new possibilities for robotics
                             applications. The profession offers jobs for a wide range of temperaments.<br/>

                            This workshop will provide school students a base to robotics for kids. They will learn
                             to control the robots using normal electrical concepts. They will be developing their
                              own models by their own hands. These projects focus on developing robots using common
                               sense and switches. The workshop focuses on application and use of technology rather
                                than their internal working so that a person can grasp the concepts well.<br/>

                           The duration of this workshop will be two consecutive days with eight hours session 
                           each day, in a total of sixteen hours properly divided into theory and hand on practical
                            sessions. At the end of this workshop a competition will be organized among the
                             participating students where each participating student will get Certificate of
                              Participation and the Winners will get Certificate of Merit.
