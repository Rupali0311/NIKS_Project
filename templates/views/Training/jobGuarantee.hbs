                    <span>It’s hard to imagine another industry that is as hooked into our changing lifestyles 
                        as digital media. For creative types with an interest in technology, it’s where the 
                        jobs lie, and for creative types who don’t have an interest in technology – well, it’s
                         still where the jobs lie.</span><br/>

                             kind of practitioner who uses great design to visualise information and make 
                             media which responds to its consumer.
