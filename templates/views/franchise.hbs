                                <h5>1. BE YOUR OWN BOSS</h5>
                                <p>Franchise ownership combines a sense of independence (within limits) with a
                                     greater level of security. The desire to control your own destiny, to build
                                      a business for yourself and a legacy for your children, has always been a 
                                      powerful motivator in business and in life.</p>

                                <h5>2. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AN EXPERIENCED BUSINESSMAN</h5>
                                <p>Franchising requires no special qualifications like MBAs, high five degrees
                                     or an experience certificate which states that you are an exceptional
                                      business person. All you need is the knowledge about the product that
                                       you will get from the franchisor, and where to set up the Franchise.</p>

                                <h5>3. Hard work is rewarded</h5>
                                <p>There's nothing better for the entrepreneurial spirit than being rewarded
                                     directly for their effort. That usually is not possible in corporate 
                                     life, where bonuses (if any) are based more on salary or employment
                                      level than on individual merit or performance.</p>
                            </div>

                            <div class="box">

                                <h5>4. Proven business system of operations</h5>
                                <p>New ideas are great. They're what makes business and the world go round.
                                     Franchising allows entrepreneurs to plug into a proven, successful idea
                                      and operating system, and focus their efforts on running the business,
                                       rather than on adjusting it in midstream. The wheel's been invented,
                                        perfected, branded, and marketed.</p>

                                <div class="img-5 img"></div>
                                <h5>5. Exclusive Territories</h5>
                                <p>Another thing your franchise fee buys you is the right to an exclusive
                                     territory, designed to provide a sufficient number of the right kind 
                                     of customers for your investment to succeed. Franchisors generally are
                                      reluctant to award territories too large for a franchisee to serve 
                                      adequately (and because they want to sell as many as they can, within
                                       reason), the smarter ones will err on the side of awarding territories
                                        that give their franchisees the best chance of success.</p>

                                <h5>6. Training and Support</h5>
                                <p>Franchisors want franchisees to succeed. In fact, they need franchisees to
                                     succeed. That's why intensive training is included in the franchise fee.
                                      Prior to opening for business, franchisees are trained in all the brand's 
                                      specifics, from cash registers and point-of-sale systems to brand identity 
                                      and culture, sales and marketing, and everything and anything that makes
                                       our brand unique.</p>
