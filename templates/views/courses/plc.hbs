                <h3>PLC SCADA</h3>
                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>A PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLER (PLC) is an industrial computer control system that 
                    continuously monitors the state of input devices and makes decisions based upon a 
                    custom program to control the state of output devices. Almost any production line, 
                    machine function, or process can be greatly enhanced using this type of control system. 
                    However, the biggest benefit in using a PLC is the ability to change and replicate the 
                    operation or process while collecting and communicating vital information.</p>
                <p> SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND DATA ACQUISITION, a computer system for gathering and analyzing 
                    real time data. SCADA systems are used to monitor and control a plant or equipment in 
                    industries such as telecommunications, water and waste control, energy, oil and gas 
                    refining and transportation. A SCADA system gathers information, such as where a leak 
                    on a pipeline has occurred, transfers the information back to a central site, alerting 
                    the home station that the leak has occurred, carrying out necessary analysis and control, 
                    such as determining if the leak is critical, and displaying the information in a logical 
                    and organized fashion. SCADA systems were first used in the 1960s.</p>
